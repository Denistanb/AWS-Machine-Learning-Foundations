# AWS Machine Learning Foundations

## Project Description

This learning journey is a curated collection of resources, Jupyter notebooks, and code examples aimed at empowering learners to develop a solid foundation in machine learning using AWS services. It explores key machine learning concepts through hands-on, cloud-based exercises and real-world scenarios, enabling both beginners and intermediate practitioners to effectively apply ML techniques within scalable AWS environments.

## Features

- Step-by-step tutorials and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning
- Practical applications of machine learning concepts
- Integration with AWS services such as S3, SageMaker, and Lambda
- Example datasets for experimentation
- Modular codebase for easy extensibility
- Sample end-to-end ML pipelines

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- AWS SageMaker
- AWS S3
- AWS Lambda
- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and other ML libraries

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine and AWS environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- An AWS account with permissions for SageMaker, S3, and Lambda
- AWS CLI configured on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Denistanb/AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations.git
   cd AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure AWS CLI:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

### Usage

- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Navigate to the desired notebook and follow the instructions for each module.
- To run SageMaker jobs or interact with AWS services, ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured.
