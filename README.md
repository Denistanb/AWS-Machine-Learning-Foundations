# AWS Machine Learning Foundations

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive collection of resources, notebooks, and code examples designed to help learners build a strong foundation in machine learning using AWS services. It covers essential machine learning concepts and provides practical examples leveraging AWS cloud tools and infrastructure, making it suitable for beginners and intermediate practitioners aiming to apply ML in scalable cloud environments.

## Features

- Step-by-step tutorials and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning
- Practical applications of machine learning concepts
- Integration with AWS services such as S3, SageMaker, and Lambda
- Example datasets for experimentation
- Modular codebase for easy extensibility
- Sample end-to-end ML pipelines

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- AWS SageMaker
- AWS S3
- AWS Lambda
- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and other ML libraries

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine and AWS environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- An AWS account with permissions for SageMaker, S3, and Lambda
- AWS CLI configured on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Denistanb/AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations.git
   cd AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure AWS CLI:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

### Usage

- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Navigate to the desired notebook and follow the instructions for each module.
- To run SageMaker jobs or interact with AWS services, ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured.
