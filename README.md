# 🚀 AWS Machine Learning Foundations – Learning Journey  

This repository contains all my hands-on work and notes from the **AWS Machine Learning Foundations** course offered by **AWS Academy**. The course is designed to teach the **end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**, using real AWS tools like **Amazon SageMaker**, **Rekognition**, **Forecast**, and **Comprehend**.

If you're exploring how **machine learning works in the cloud**, or want to understand how to build and deploy ML models using AWS services — this repo is for you.
